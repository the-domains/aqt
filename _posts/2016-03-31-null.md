Beyond the Diffraction Barrier is a scientific 3D animation that visually explains key principles of several important super-resolution microscopy (SRM) techniques, including foundational concepts of fluorescence and laser scanning microscopy. Simultaneously, neurobiology is introduced at the mesoscale level, with an emphasis on relative size of cellular and sub-cellular structures. This is a Master's Research Project for the degree of Master of Science in Biomedical Communications.
